  abstract  = {`els are increasing in size and complexity in the hunt for SOTA. But what if those 2{\%}increase in performance does not make a difference in a production use case? Maybe benefits from a smaller, faster model outweigh those slight performance gains. Also, equally good performance across languages in multilingual tasks is more important than SOTA results on a single one. We present the biggest, unified, multilingual collection of sentiment analysis datasets. We use these to assess 11 models and 80 high-quality sentiment datasets (out of 342 raw datasets collected) in 27 languages and included results on the internally annotated datasets. We deeply evaluate multiple setups, including fine-tuning transformer-based models for measuring performance. We compare results in numerous dimensions addressing the imbalance in both languages coverage and dataset sizes. Finally, we present some best practices for working with such a massive collection of datasets and models for a multi-lingual perspective.}

We introduce a new data set of over 530k anonymized public Facebook posts across 18 languages, labeled with five different emotions. Using multilingual BERT embeddings, we show that emotions can be reliably inferred both within and across languages. Zero-shot learning produces promising results for low-resource languages. Following established theories of basic emotions, we provide a detailed analysis of the possibilities and limits of cross-lingual emotion classification. We find that structural and typological similarity between languages facilitates cross-lingual learning, as well as linguistic diversity of training data. Our results suggest that there are commonalities underlying the expression of emotion in different languages. We publicly release the anonymized data for future research.}

For the CNN, we also created German word embeddings trained on 300M tweets. These word embeddings were then optimized for sentiment analysis using distant-supervised learning.

Given the annotated dataset of positive, neutral, and negative news in Slovene, the aim is to develop a news classification system that assigns the sentiment category not only to Slovene news, but to news in another language without any training data required. Our system is based on the multilingual BERTmodel, while we test different approaches for handling long documents and propose a novel technique for sentiment enrichment of the BERT model as an intermediate training step. With the proposed approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the sentiment analysis task on Slovenian news. We evaluate the zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities of our system on a novel news sentiment test set in Croatian. The results show that the cross-lingual approach also largely outperforms the majority classifier, as well as all settings without sentiment enrichment in pre-training.},

There are many existing researches in the field of Arabic language Sentiment Analysis (SA); however, they are generally restricted to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or some dialects of economic or political interest. In this paper we are interested in the SA of the Tunisian Dialect. We utilize Machine Learning techniques to determine the polarity of comments written in Tunisian Dialect. First, we evaluate the SA systems performances with models trained using freely available MSA and Multi-dialectal data sets. We then collect and annotate a Tunisian Dialect corpus of 17.000 comments from Facebook. This corpus allows us a significant accuracy improvement compared to the best model trained on other Arabic dialects or MSA data. We believe that this first freely available corpus will be valuable to researchers working in the field of Tunisian Sentiment Analysis and similar areas.}

  abstract  = {This paper empirically studies the effects of representation choices on neural sentiment analysis for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically rich language (MRL) for which no sentiment analyzer currently exists. We study two dimensions of representational choices: (i) the granularity of the input signal (token-based vs. morpheme-based), and (ii) the level of encoding of vocabulary items (string-based vs. character-based). We hypothesise that for MRLs, languages where multiple meaning-bearing elements may be carried by a single space-delimited token, these choices will have measurable effects on task perfromance, and that these effects may vary for different architectural designs {---} fully-connected, convolutional or recurrent. Specifically, we hypothesize that morpheme-based representations will have advantages in terms of their generalization capacity and task accuracy, due to their better OOV coverage. To empirically study these effects, we develop a new sentiment analysis benchmark for Hebrew, based on 12K social media comments, and provide two instances of these data: in token-based and morpheme-based settings. Our experiments show that representation choices empirical effects vary with architecture type. While fully-connected and convolutional networks slightly prefer token-based settings, RNNs benefit from a morpheme-based representation, in accord with the hypothesis that explicit morphological information may help generalize. Our endeavour also delivers the first state-of-the-art broad-coverage sentiment analyzer for Hebrew, with over 89{\%} accuracy, alongside an established benchmark to further study the effects of linguistic representation choices on neural networks{'} task performance.}

  abstract = { Sentiment analysis is held to be one of the highly dynamic recent research fields in Natural Language Processing, facilitated by the quickly growing volume of Web opinion data. Most of the approaches in this field are focused on English due to the lack of sentiment resources in other languages such as the Arabic language and its large variety of dialects. In most sentiment analysis applications, good sentiment resources play a critical role. Based on that, in this article, several publicly available sentiment analysis resources for Arabic are introduced. This article introduces the Arabic senti-lexicon, a list of 3880 positive and negative synsets annotated with their part of speech, polarity scores, dialects synsets and inflected forms. This article also presents a Multi-domain Arabic Sentiment Corpus (MASC) with a size of 8860 positive and negative reviews from different domains. In this article, an in-depth study has been conducted on five types of feature sets for exploiting effective features and investigating their effect on performance of Arabic sentiment analysis. The aim is to assess the quality of the developed language resources and to integrate different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesise a more accurate sentiment analysis method. The Arabic senti-lexicon is used for generating feature vectors. Five well-known machine learning algorithms: naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines (SVMs), logistic linear regression and neural network are employed as base-classifiers for each of the feature sets. A wide range of comparative experiments on standard Arabic data sets were conducted, discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn. The experimental results show that the Arabic senti-lexicon is a very useful resource for Arabic sentiment analysis. Moreover, results show that classifiers which are trained on feature vectors derived from the corpus using the Arabic sentiment lexicon are more accurate than classifiers trained using the raw corpus. }

  abstract   = {Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related
                information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tass,
                such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in
                the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment
                analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect
                indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms
                used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by
                topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version
                of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social
                web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse
                social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate
                that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline
                approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength
                is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators
                of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related
                discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is
                robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},

              economic and financial content from five Slovene media resources
              on the web. More than 10,000 of them were manually annotated as
              negative, neutral or positive. All corpora are publicly available
              under a Creative Commons copyright license. We used the annotated
              documents to construct a Slovene sentiment lexicon, which is the
              first of its kind for Slovene, and to assess the sentiment
              classification approaches used. The constructed corpora were also
              utilised to monitor within-the-document sentiment dynamics, its
              changes over time and relations with news topics. We show that
              sentiment is, on average, more explicit at the beginning of

Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark.},

In order to remedy this deficiency, this paper presents an empirical study of sentiment categorization on Chinese documents. Four feature selection methods (MI, IG, CHI and DF) and five learning methods (centroid classifier, K-nearest neighbor, winnow classifier, Naïve Bayes and SVM) are investigated on a Chinese sentiment corpus with a size of 1021 documents. The experimental results indicate that IG performs the best for sentimental terms selection and SVM exhibits the best performance for sentiment classification. Furthermore, we found that sentiment classifiers are severely dependent on domains or topics.}

We employ two sentiment classification methods as baselines for our new data set, one based on low-level features (character n-grams) and one based on high-level features (bag-of-word-embeddings generated by clustering word embeddings with k-means). As an additional contribution, we replace the k-means clustering algorithm with self-organizing maps (SOMs), obtaining better results because the generated clusters of word embeddings are closer to the Zipf{'}s law distribution, which is known to govern natural language. We also demonstrate the generalization capacity of using SOMs for the clustering of word embeddings on another recently-introduced Romanian data set, for text categorization by topic.}

In this paper we present a dataset balancing algorithm that minimizes the sample selection bias by eliminating irrelevant systematic differences between the sentiment classes. We prove its superiority over the random sampling method and we use it to create the Serbian movie review dataset ― SerbMR ― the first balanced and topically uniform sentiment analysis dataset in Serbian. In addition, we propose an incremental way of finding the optimal combination of simple text processing options and machine learning features for sentiment classification. Several popular classifiers are used in conjunction with this evaluation approach in order to establish strong but reliable baselines for sentiment analysis in Serbian.}

This problem is especially conspicuous in resource-limited settings and languages, where design options are restricted either in terms of manpower and financial means required to produce appropriate sentiment analysis resources, or in terms of available language tools, or both. In this paper, we present a versatile approach to addressing this issue, based on multiple interpretations of sentiment labels that encode information regarding the polarity, subjectivity, and ambiguity of a text, as well as the presence of sarcasm or a mixture of sentiments. We demonstrate its use on Serbian, a resource-limited language, via the creation of a main sentiment analysis dataset focused on movie comments, and two smaller datasets belonging to the movie and book domains. In addition to measuring the quality of the annotation process, we propose a novel metric to validate its cost-effectiveness. Finally, the practicality of our approach is further validated by training, evaluating, and determining the optimal configurations of several different kinds of machine-learning models on a range of sentiment classification tasks using the produced dataset.},

  abstract = {On social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, people express their views, arguments, and emotions of many events in daily life. Twitter is an international microblogging service featuring short messages called ``tweets'' from different languages. These texts often consist of noise in the form of incorrect grammar, abbreviations, freestyle, and typographical errors. Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to predict the actual emotions from the raw text expressed by the people through the field of natural language processing (NLP). The main aim of our work is to process the raw sentence from the Twitter dataset and find the actual polarity of the message. This paper proposes a text normalization with deep convolutional character level embedding (Conv-char-Emb) neural network model for SA of unstructured data. This model can tackle the problems: (1) processing the noisy sentence for sentiment detection (2) handling small memory space in word level embedded learning (3) accurate sentiment analysis of the unstructured data. The initial preprocessing stage for performing text normalization includes the following steps: tokenization, out of vocabulary (OOV) detection and its replacement, lemmatization and stemming. A character-based embedding in convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective and efficient technique for SA that uses less learnable parameters in feature representation. Thus, the proposed method performs both the normalization and classification of sentiments for unstructured sentences. The experimental results are evaluated in the Twitter dataset by a different point polarity (positive, negative and neutral). As a result, our model performs well in normalization and sentiment analysis of the raw Twitter data enriched with hidden information.},

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.},
