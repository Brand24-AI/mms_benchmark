Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets.

Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tass,\n    such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in\n    the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment\n    analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect\n    indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms\n    used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by\n    topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version\n    of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social\n    web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse\n    social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate\n    that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline\n    approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength\n    is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators\n    of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related\n    discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is\n    robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},\n    journal = {J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci.

Hebrew, a morphologically rich language (MRL) for which no sentiment analyzer currently exists. We study two dimensions of representational choices: (i) the granularity of the input signal (token-based vs. morpheme-based), and (ii) the level of encoding of vocabulary items (string-based vs. character-based). We hypothesise that for MRLs, languages where multiple meaning-bearing elements may be carried by a single space-delimited token, these choices will have measurable effects on task perfromance, and that these effects may vary for different architectural designs {---} fully-connected, convolutional or recurrent. Specifically, we hypothesize that morpheme-based representations will have advantages in terms of their generalization capacity and task accuracy, due to their better OOV coverage. To empirically study these effects, we develop a new sentiment analysis benchmark for Hebrew, based on 12K social media comments, and provide two instances of these data: in token-based and morpheme-based settings. Our experiments show that representation choices empirical effects vary with architecture type. While fully-connected and convolutional networks slightly prefer token-based settings, RNNs benefit from a morpheme-based representation, in accord with the hypothesis that explicit morphological information may help generalize. Our endeavour also delivers the first state-of-the-art broad-coverage sentiment analyzer for Hebrew, with over 89{\\%} accuracy, alongside an established benchmark to further study the effects of linguistic representation choices on neural networks{'} task performance.\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hi\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Indic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 3\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SOV\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SONegV\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_semeval_2020,\n    title = \"{S}em{E}val-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets\",\n    author = {Patwa, Parth  and\n        Aguilar, Gustavo  and\n        Kar, Sudipta  and\n        Pandey, Suraj  and\n        PYKL, Srinivas  and\n        Gamb{\\\"a}ck, Bj{\\\"o}rn  and\n        Chakraborty, Tanmoy  and\n        Solorio, Thamar  and\n        Das, Amitava},\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation\",\n    month = dec,\n    year = \"2020\",\n    address = \"Barcelona (online)\",\n    publisher = \"International Committee for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.100\",\n    doi = \"10.18653/v1/2020.semeval-1.100\",\n    pages = \"774--790\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: news\nLanguage: hr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@Article{dataset_hr_sentiment_news_document,\n    AUTHOR = {Pelicon, Andraž and Pranjić, Marko and Miljković, Dragana and Škrlj, Blaž and Pollak, Senja},\n    TITLE = {Zero-Shot Learning for Cross-Lingual News Sentiment Classification},\n    JOURNAL = {Applied Sciences},\n    VOLUME = {10},\n    YEAR = {2020},\n    NUMBER = {17},\n    ARTICLE-NUMBER = {5993},\n    URL = {https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/17/5993},\n    ISSN = {2076-3417},\n    ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we address the task of zero-shot cross-lingual news sentiment classification. Given the annotated dataset of positive, neutral, and negative news in Slovene, the aim is to develop a news classification system that assigns the sentiment category not only to Slovene news, but to news in another language without any training data required. Our system is based on the multilingual BERTmodel, while we test different approaches for handling long documents and propose a novel technique for sentiment enrichment of the BERT model as an intermediate training step. With the proposed approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the sentiment analysis task on Slovenian news. We evaluate the zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities of our system on a novel news sentiment test set in Croatian. The results show that the cross-lingual approach also largely outperforms the majority classifier, as well as all settings without sentiment enrichment in pre-training.},\n    DOI = {10.3390/app10175993}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hu\nLanguage family: Uralic\nGenus: Ugric\nDefinite articles: definite word distinct from demonstrative\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word distinct from one\nNumber of cases: 10 or more\nOrder of subject, object, verb: no dominant order\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: no grammatical gender\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: it\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Romance\nDefinite articles: definite word distinct from demonstrative\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word same as one\nNumber of cases: no morphological case-making\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: interrogative intonation only\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_it_evalita2016,\n    TITLE = {{Overview of the Evalita 2016 SENTIment POLarity Classification Task}},\n    AUTHOR = {Barbieri, Francesco and Basile, Valerio and Croce, Danilo and Nissim, Malvina and Novielli, Nicole and Patti, Viviana},\n    URL = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01414731},\n    BOOKTITLE = {{Proceedings of Third Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it 2016) \\& Fifth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian.

More than 10,000 of them were manually annotated as negative, neutral or positive. All corpora are publicly available under a Creative Commons copyright license. We used the annotated documents to construct a Slovene sentiment lexicon, which is the first of its kind for Slovene, and to assess the sentiment classification approaches used. The constructed corpora were also utilised to monitor within-the-document sentiment dynamics, its changes over time and relations with news topics. We show that sentiment is, on average, more explicit at the beginning of documents, and it loses sharpness towards the end of documents.},\n    issn={1574-0218},\n    doi={10.1007/s10579-018-9413-3},\n    url={https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-018-9413-3}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sl\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 6-7\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sq\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Albanian\nDefinite articles: definite affix\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word distinct from one\nNumber of cases: 4\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: reviews\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_sr_serb_movie_reviews,\n    title = \"Reliable Baselines for Sentiment Analysis in Resource-Limited Languages: The {S}erbian Movie Review Dataset\",\n    author = \"Batanovi{\\'c}, Vuk  and\n        Nikoli{\\'c}, Bo{\\v{s}}ko  and\n        Milosavljevi{\\'c}, Milan\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'16)\",\n    month = may,\n    year = \"2016\",\n    address = \"Portoro{\\v{z}}, Slovenia\",\n    publisher = \"European Language Resources Association (ELRA)\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/L16-1427\",\n    pages = \"2688--2696\",\n    abstract = \"Collecting data for sentiment analysis in resource-limited languages carries a significant risk of sample selection bias, since the small quantities of available data are most likely not representative of the whole population. Ignoring this bias leads to less robust machine learning classifiers and less reliable evaluation results. In this paper we present a dataset balancing algorithm that minimizes the sample selection bias by eliminating irrelevant systematic differences between the sentiment classes. We prove its superiority over the random sampling method and we use it to create the Serbian movie review dataset ― SerbMR ― the first balanced and topically uniform sentiment analysis dataset in Serbian. In addition, we propose an incremental way of finding the optimal combination of simple text processing options and machine learning features for sentiment classification. Several popular classifiers are used in conjunction with this evaluation approach in order to establish strong but reliable baselines for sentiment analysis in Serbian.\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: reviews\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_sr_senticomments,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0242050},\n    author = {Batanović, Vuk AND Cvetanović, Miloš AND Nikolić, Boško},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {A versatile framework for resource-limited sentiment articulation, annotation, and analysis of short texts},\n    year = {2020},\n    month = {11},\n    volume = {15},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242050},\n    pages = {1-30},\n    abstract = {Choosing a comprehensive and cost-effective way of articulating and annotating the sentiment of a text is not a trivial task, particularly when dealing with short texts, in which sentiment can be expressed through a wide variety of linguistic and rhetorical phenomena. This problem is especially conspicuous in resource-limited settings and languages, where design options are restricted either in terms of manpower and financial means required to produce appropriate sentiment analysis resources, or in terms of available language tools, or both. In this paper, we present a versatile approach to addressing this issue, based on multiple interpretations of sentiment labels that encode information regarding the polarity, subjectivity, and ambiguity of a text, as well as the presence of sarcasm or a mixture of sentiments. We demonstrate its use on Serbian, a resource-limited language, via the creation of a main sentiment analysis dataset focused on movie comments, and two smaller datasets belonging to the movie and book domains. In addition to measuring the quality of the annotation process, we propose a novel metric to validate its cost-effectiveness. Finally, the practicality of our approach is further validated by training, evaluating, and determining the optimal configurations of several different kinds of machine-learning models on a range of sentiment classification tasks using the produced dataset.},\n    number = {11},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no

Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets.

Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets.

Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tass,\n    such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in\n    the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment\n    analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect\n    indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms\n    used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by\n    topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version\n    of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social\n    web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse\n    social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate\n    that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline\n    approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength\n    is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators\n    of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related\n    discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is\n    robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.},\n    journal = {J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci.

Hebrew, a morphologically rich language (MRL) for which no sentiment analyzer currently exists. We study two dimensions of representational choices: (i) the granularity of the input signal (token-based vs. morpheme-based), and (ii) the level of encoding of vocabulary items (string-based vs. character-based). We hypothesise that for MRLs, languages where multiple meaning-bearing elements may be carried by a single space-delimited token, these choices will have measurable effects on task perfromance, and that these effects may vary for different architectural designs {---} fully-connected, convolutional or recurrent. Specifically, we hypothesize that morpheme-based representations will have advantages in terms of their generalization capacity and task accuracy, due to their better OOV coverage. To empirically study these effects, we develop a new sentiment analysis benchmark for Hebrew, based on 12K social media comments, and provide two instances of these data: in token-based and morpheme-based settings. Our experiments show that representation choices empirical effects vary with architecture type. While fully-connected and convolutional networks slightly prefer token-based settings, RNNs benefit from a morpheme-based representation, in accord with the hypothesis that explicit morphological information may help generalize. Our endeavour also delivers the first state-of-the-art broad-coverage sentiment analyzer for Hebrew, with over 89{\\%} accuracy, alongside an established benchmark to further study the effects of linguistic representation choices on neural networks{'} task performance.\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hi\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Indic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 3\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SOV\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SONegV\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_semeval_2020,\n    title = \"{S}em{E}val-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets\",\n    author = {Patwa, Parth  and\n        Aguilar, Gustavo  and\n        Kar, Sudipta  and\n        Pandey, Suraj  and\n        PYKL, Srinivas  and\n        Gamb{\\\"a}ck, Bj{\\\"o}rn  and\n        Chakraborty, Tanmoy  and\n        Solorio, Thamar  and\n        Das, Amitava},\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation\",\n    month = dec,\n    year = \"2020\",\n    address = \"Barcelona (online)\",\n    publisher = \"International Committee for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.100\",\n    doi = \"10.18653/v1/2020.semeval-1.100\",\n    pages = \"774--790\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: news\nLanguage: hr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@Article{dataset_hr_sentiment_news_document,\n    AUTHOR = {Pelicon, Andraž and Pranjić, Marko and Miljković, Dragana and Škrlj, Blaž and Pollak, Senja},\n    TITLE = {Zero-Shot Learning for Cross-Lingual News Sentiment Classification},\n    JOURNAL = {Applied Sciences},\n    VOLUME = {10},\n    YEAR = {2020},\n    NUMBER = {17},\n    ARTICLE-NUMBER = {5993},\n    URL = {https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/17/5993},\n    ISSN = {2076-3417},\n    ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we address the task of zero-shot cross-lingual news sentiment classification. Given the annotated dataset of positive, neutral, and negative news in Slovene, the aim is to develop a news classification system that assigns the sentiment category not only to Slovene news, but to news in another language without any training data required. Our system is based on the multilingual BERTmodel, while we test different approaches for handling long documents and propose a novel technique for sentiment enrichment of the BERT model as an intermediate training step. With the proposed approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the sentiment analysis task on Slovenian news. We evaluate the zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities of our system on a novel news sentiment test set in Croatian. The results show that the cross-lingual approach also largely outperforms the majority classifier, as well as all settings without sentiment enrichment in pre-training.},\n    DOI = {10.3390/app10175993}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: hu\nLanguage family: Uralic\nGenus: Ugric\nDefinite articles: definite word distinct from demonstrative\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word distinct from one\nNumber of cases: 10 or more\nOrder of subject, object, verb: no dominant order\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: no grammatical gender\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: it\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Romance\nDefinite articles: definite word distinct from demonstrative\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word same as one\nNumber of cases: no morphological case-making\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: interrogative intonation only\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_it_evalita2016,\n    TITLE = {{Overview of the Evalita 2016 SENTIment POLarity Classification Task}},\n    AUTHOR = {Barbieri, Francesco and Basile, Valerio and Croce, Danilo and Nissim, Malvina and Novielli, Nicole and Patti, Viviana},\n    URL = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01414731},\n    BOOKTITLE = {{Proceedings of Third Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it 2016) \\& Fifth Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian.

More than 10,000 of them were manually annotated as negative, neutral or positive. All corpora are publicly available under a Creative Commons copyright license. We used the annotated documents to construct a Slovene sentiment lexicon, which is the first of its kind for Slovene, and to assess the sentiment classification approaches used. The constructed corpora were also utilised to monitor within-the-document sentiment dynamics, its changes over time and relations with news topics. We show that sentiment is, on average, more explicit at the beginning of documents, and it loses sharpness towards the end of documents.},\n    issn={1574-0218},\n    doi={10.1007/s10579-018-9413-3},\n    url={https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-018-9413-3}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sl\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 6-7\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sq\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Albanian\nDefinite articles: definite affix\nIndefinite articles: indefinite word distinct from one\nNumber of cases: 4\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: SNegVO\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine\n\n@article{dataset_twitter_sentiment,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    author = {Mozetič, Igor AND Grčar, Miha AND Smailović, Jasmina},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators},\n    year = {2016},\n    month = {05},\n    volume = {11},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155036},\n    pages = {1-26},\n    number = {5},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: reviews\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@inproceedings{dataset_sr_serb_movie_reviews,\n    title = \"Reliable Baselines for Sentiment Analysis in Resource-Limited Languages: The {S}erbian Movie Review Dataset\",\n    author = \"Batanovi{\\'c}, Vuk  and\n        Nikoli{\\'c}, Bo{\\v{s}}ko  and\n        Milosavljevi{\\'c}, Milan\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation ({LREC}'16)\",\n    month = may,\n    year = \"2016\",\n    address = \"Portoro{\\v{z}}, Slovenia\",\n    publisher = \"European Language Resources Association (ELRA)\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/L16-1427\",\n    pages = \"2688--2696\",\n    abstract = \"Collecting data for sentiment analysis in resource-limited languages carries a significant risk of sample selection bias, since the small quantities of available data are most likely not representative of the whole population. Ignoring this bias leads to less robust machine learning classifiers and less reliable evaluation results. In this paper we present a dataset balancing algorithm that minimizes the sample selection bias by eliminating irrelevant systematic differences between the sentiment classes. We prove its superiority over the random sampling method and we use it to create the Serbian movie review dataset ― SerbMR ― the first balanced and topically uniform sentiment analysis dataset in Serbian. In addition, we propose an incremental way of finding the optimal combination of simple text processing options and machine learning features for sentiment classification. Several popular classifiers are used in conjunction with this evaluation approach in order to establish strong but reliable baselines for sentiment analysis in Serbian.\",\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: reviews\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no article\nIndefinite articles: no article\nNumber of cases: 5\nOrder of subject, object, verb: SVO\nNegative morphemes: negative particle\nPolar questions: question particle\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV: other\nPrefixing vs suffixing: strongly suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality: plural suffix\nGrammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter\n\n@article{dataset_sr_senticomments,\n    doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0242050},\n    author = {Batanović, Vuk AND Cvetanović, Miloš AND Nikolić, Boško},\n    journal = {PLOS ONE},\n    publisher = {Public Library of Science},\n    title = {A versatile framework for resource-limited sentiment articulation, annotation, and analysis of short texts},\n    year = {2020},\n    month = {11},\n    volume = {15},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242050},\n    pages = {1-30},\n    abstract = {Choosing a comprehensive and cost-effective way of articulating and annotating the sentiment of a text is not a trivial task, particularly when dealing with short texts, in which sentiment can be expressed through a wide variety of linguistic and rhetorical phenomena. This problem is especially conspicuous in resource-limited settings and languages, where design options are restricted either in terms of manpower and financial means required to produce appropriate sentiment analysis resources, or in terms of available language tools, or both. In this paper, we present a versatile approach to addressing this issue, based on multiple interpretations of sentiment labels that encode information regarding the polarity, subjectivity, and ambiguity of a text, as well as the presence of sarcasm or a mixture of sentiments. We demonstrate its use on Serbian, a resource-limited language, via the creation of a main sentiment analysis dataset focused on movie comments, and two smaller datasets belonging to the movie and book domains. In addition to measuring the quality of the annotation process, we propose a novel metric to validate its cost-effectiveness. Finally, the practicality of our approach is further validated by training, evaluating, and determining the optimal configurations of several different kinds of machine-learning models on a range of sentiment classification tasks using the produced dataset.},\n    number = {11},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain: social_media\nLanguage: sr\nLanguage family: Indo-European\nGenus: Slavic\nDefinite articles: no

This is particularly true for language tasks that are culture-dependent. One such example is the area of multilingual sentiment analysis, where affective markers can be subtle and deeply ensconced in culture.\nThis work presents the most extensive open massively multilingual corpus of datasets for training sentiment models. The corpus consists of 79 manually selected datasets from over 350 datasets reported in the scientific literature based on strict quality criteria. The corpus covers 27 languages representing 6 language families. Datasets can be queried using several linguistic and functional features. In addition, we present a multi-faceted sentiment classification benchmark summarizing hundreds of experiments conducted on different base models, training objectives, dataset collections, and fine-tuning strategies."

This step reduces the time and effort required for researchers to acknowledge the datasets’ sources properly.\nHowever, it is essential to note that while we have taken steps to streamline the citation process, researchers should still independently verify the licenses of the datasets, especially if they intend to use them for purposes beyond strict academic research.

Researchers can easily access datasets that match their desired linguistic typology criteria by offering these features as filtering options in our library.\nFor instance, researchers can download datasets specific to Slavic languages with interrogative word order for polar questions or datasets from the Afro-Asiatic language family without morphological case-making.

These differences can be categorized into phonological (sounds), syntactic (structures), lexical (vocabulary), and theoretical aspects. Linguistic typology analyzes the current state of languages, contrasting with genealogical linguistics, which examines historical relationships between languages.\nGenealogical linguistics studies language families and genera. A language family consists of languages that share a common ancestral language, while genera are branches within a language family. The Indo-European family, for example, includes genera such as Slavic, Romance, Germanic, and Indic. Over 7000 languages are categorized into approximately 150 language families, with Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Turkic, Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo, and Eskimo-Aleut being some of the largest families.\nWithin linguistic typology, languages are described using various linguistic features. Our work focuses on sentiment classification and selects ten relevant features:\n\ntext: The feature text represents the actual text of the sentiment dataset. It is of type string and contains the text samples or sentences for sentiment analysis.\nlabel: The feature label corresponds to the sentiment labels of the text samples. It is of type ClassLabel and has three possible values: negative, neutral, and positive. These labels indicate the sentiment or emotional polarity associated with the text.\noriginal_dataset: The feature original_dataset refers to the name or identifier of the original dataset from which the text samples were extracted. It is of type string and provides information about the source dataset.\ndomain: The feature domain represents the domain or topic of the sentiment dataset. It is of type string and provides context regarding the subject matter of the text samples.\nlanguage: The feature language indicates the language of the text samples in the sentiment dataset. It is of type string and specifies the language in which the text is written.\nFamily: The feature Family represents the language family to which a specific language belongs. It is of type string and provides information about the broader categorization of languages into language families.\nGenus: The feature Genus corresponds to the genus or branch within a language family. It is of type string and indicates the specific subgrouping of languages within a language family.\nDefinite article: Half of the languages do not use the definite article, which signals uniqueness or definiteness of a concept.\nIndefinite article: Half of the languages do not use the indefinite article, with some languages using a separate article or the numeral “one.”\nNumber of cases: Languages vary greatly in the number of morphological cases used.\nOrder of subject, verb, and object: Different languages have different word orderings, with variations like SOV, SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS, and OSV.\nNegative morphemes: Negative morphemes indicate clausal negation in declarative sentences.\nPolar questions: Questions with yes/no answers, which can be formed using question particles, interrogative morphology, or intonation.\nPosition of the negative morpheme: The position of the negative morpheme can vary in relation to subjects and objects.\nPrefixing vs. suffixing: Languages differ in their use of prefixes and suffixes in inflectional morphology.\nCoding of nominal plurals: Plurals can be expressed through morphological changes or the use of plurality indicator morphemes.\nGrammatical genders: Languages vary in the number of grammatical genders used, or may not use the concept at all.\n\nThese language features are available as filtering options in our library. Users can download specific facets of the collection, such as datasets in Slavic languages with interrogative word order for polar questions or datasets from the Afro-Asiatic language family without morphological case-making."

It is of type string and provides information about the broader categorization of languages into language families.\nGenus: The feature Genus corresponds to the genus or branch within a language family. It is of type string and indicates the specific subgrouping of languages within a language family.\nDefinite article: Half of the languages do not use the definite article, which signals uniqueness or definiteness of a concept.\nIndefinite article: Half of the languages do not use the indefinite article, with some languages using a separate article or the numeral “one.”\nNumber of cases: Languages vary greatly in the number of morphological cases used.\nOrder of subject, verb, and object: Different languages have different word orderings, with variations like SOV, SVO, VSO, VOS, OVS, and OSV.\nNegative morphemes: Negative morphemes indicate clausal negation in declarative sentences.\nPolar questions: Questions with yes/no answers, which can be formed using question particles, interrogative morphology, or intonation.\nPosition of the negative morpheme: The position of the negative morpheme can vary in relation to subjects and objects.\nPrefixing vs. suffixing: Languages differ in their use of prefixes and suffixes in inflectional morphology.\nCoding of nominal plurals: Plurals can be expressed through morphological changes or the use of plurality indicator morphemes.\nGrammatical genders: Languages vary in the number of grammatical genders used, or may not use the concept at all.\n\nThese language features are available as filtering options in our library. Users can download specific facets of the collection, such as datasets in Slavic languages with interrogative word order for polar questions or datasets from the Afro-Asiatic language family without morphological case-making."

    "text": "Datasheets for Datasets\nThe datasheets provide detailed information about the datasets, including data collection methods, annotation guidelines, and potential biases. They also specify the intended uses and potential limitations of the datasets.\nThe initial pool of sentiment datasets was gathered through an extensive search using sources such as Google Scholar, GitHub repositories, and the HuggingFace datasets library. This search yielded a total of 345 datasets.\nTo ensure the quality of the datasets, a set of quality assurance criteria was applied to manually filter the initial pool of datasets. The following criteria were used:\n\nStrong Annotations: Datasets containing weak annotations, such as labels based on emoji occurrence or automatically generated through classification by machine learning models, were rejected. This decision was made to minimize the presence of noise in the datasets, ensuring higher quality annotations.\nWell-Defined Annotation Protocol: Datasets without sufficient information about the annotation protocol, including whether the annotation was done manually or automatically and the number of annotators involved, were rejected. This step aimed to avoid merging datasets with contradicting annotation instructions, ensuring consistency across the selected datasets.\nNumerical Ratings: Datasets with numerical ratings were accepted. Specifically, Likert-type 5-point scales were mapped into three class sentiment labels. Ratings 1 and 2 were mapped to “negative,” rating 3 was mapped to “neutral,” and ratings 4 and 5 were mapped to “positive.” This mapping allowed for consistent sentiment labeling across the datasets.\nThree Classes Only: Datasets annotated with binary sentiment labels were rejected. The decision to focus on datasets with three sentiment classes (negative, neutral, and positive) was made based on the unsatisfactory performance of binary sentiment labeling in three-class settings.\nMonolingual Datasets: In cases where a dataset contained samples in multiple languages, it was divided into independent datasets for each constituent language. This approach ensured that the corpus includes separate datasets for different languages, allowing for targeted analysis and evaluation.\n\nBy applying these quality assurance criteria, we were able to filter the initial pool of sentiment datasets and select a final set of 79 datasets that met the specified standards for inclusion in the multilingual corpus.\n\nf\"We cover {mms_dataset_df.original_dataset.nunique()} datasets in {mms_dataset_df.language.nunique()} languages.\"\n\n'We cover 79 datasets in 27 languages.'\n\n\n\nf\"The classes that we cover: {mms_dataset_df.label_name.unique()}\"\n\n\"The classes that we cover: ['positive' 'neutral' 'negative']\""

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nDespite the fact that our collection is the largest public collection of multilingual sentiment datasets, it still covers only 27 languages. The collection of datasets is highly biased towards the Indo-European family of languages, English in particular. We attribute this bias to the general culture of scientific publishing and its enforcement of English as the primary carrier of scientific discovery. Our work’s main potential negative social impact is that the models developed and trained using the provided datasets may still exhibit better performance for the major languages. This could further perpetuate the existing language disparities and inequality in sentiment analysis capabilities across different languages. Addressing this limitation and working towards more equitable representation and performance across languages is crucial to avoid reinforcing language biases and the potential marginalization of underrepresented languages. The ethical implications of such disparities should be thoroughly discussed and considered.\n\n\n\nData Quality\n\n\nAn important limitation of our dataset collection is a significant variance in sample quality across all datasets and all languages. Above figure presents the distribution of self-confidence label-quality score for each data point computed by the cleanlab (Northcutt, Jiang, and Chuang 2021). The distribution of quality is skewed in favor of popular languages, with low-resource languages suffering from data quality issues. A related limitation is caused by an unequal distribution of data modalities across languages. For instance, our benchmark clearly shows that all models universally underperform when tested on Portuguese datasets. This is the direct result of the fact that data points for Portuguese almost exclusively represent the domain of social media. As a consequence, some combinations of filtering facets in our dataset collection produce very little data (i.e., asking for social media data in the Germanic genus of Indo-European languages will produce a significantly larger dataset than asking for news data representing Afro-Asiatic languages).\nFinally, we acknowledge the lack of internal coherence of annotation protocols between datasets and languages. We have enforced strict quality criteria and rejected all datasets published without the annotation protocol, but we were unable, for obvious reasons, to unify annotation guidelines. The annotation of sentiment expressions and the assignment of sentiment labels are heavily subjective and, at the same time, influenced by cultural and linguistic features. Unfortunately, it is possible that semantically similar utterances will be assigned conflicting labels if they come from different datasets or modalities.\n\nFilter examples by annotation qualitym\nWe know how imporant data quality is for the model training processes. Hence, we added cleanlab scores to each of 6M+ examples in all datasets. Now, it is enalbe to filter examples based on how good quality of data do you need for traning.\nWe can sort examples by top data quality. Cleanlab’s self confidence is a function to compute label-quality scores for classification datasets, where lower scores indicate labels less likely to be correct. Hence, for the best quality we want to have the highest scores.\n\nclean_labels_data = mms_dataset_df.sort_values(by=\"cleanlab_self_confidence\", ascending=False).head(10_000)\n\n\nclean_labels_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\ntext\nlabel\noriginal_dataset\ndomain\nlanguage\nFamily\nGenus\nDefinite articles\nIndefinite articles\nNumber of cases\nOrder of subject, object, verb\nNegative morphemes\nPolar questions\nPosition of negative word wrt SOV\nPrefixing vs suffixing\nCoding of nominal plurality\nGrammatical genders\ncleanlab_self_confidence\nlabel_name\n\n\n\n\n3075302\n3075302\nGreat addition to any fan's yard!
